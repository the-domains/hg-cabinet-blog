  Remodeling and Permits: When is it Necessary? “Did you get a permit for that?”
  are probably words that you may hear even while completing seemingly simple
  DIY renovation tasks. Although it can be a pain to go through the process, you
  will feel more confident about your work knowing that it is allowed in your
  area! Did you know that you could be fined or penalized for going through with
  a project without a permit if it is required? Although it probably wouldn’t
  affect you in the short run, it may just catch up! Of course with smaller
  projects (painting, tiling, moving cabinetry, etc.) cities do not require the
  same thorough compliance as do with other projects. In general, a building
  permit is required by your city of residence whenever you undertake the
  erection, construction, alteration, movement, enlargement, improvement,
  conversion, removal or demolition of a building. Just about every conceivable
  type of work falls into one of these categories. Electrical rewiring work,
  plumbing, tearing down a wall, fixing the roof and adding a bathroom are just
  a few examples. Because the process of getting a permit can be a hassle and
  they have a fee associated with them, some home owners are tempted to sidestep
  the permit process not wanting to pay the fees (municipalities generally
  charge a minimum issuing fee—such as $25—as well as an additional
  fee—sometimes 1 percent—of total construction costs), or they might not want
  to risk delaying a project or a sale by waiting for city inspections
  (obtaining permits can take anywhere from a day to six weeks or more). The
  main reason a city requires permits for some renovation projects is to ensure
  sure work is being done safely. If you do have specific questions regarding
  your city’s protocols, make sure to contact them and double check! Another
  option would be to talk to local contractors and architects on what is
  allowed. We compiled a list of well-known projects that usually (but really,
  double check with your city) require permits: • Demolishing a load-bearing
  wall • Changing the house's roofline • Altering the footprint of your house •
  Installing any new electrical wiring • Installing a fence over a certain
  height, such as 6' • Parking your roll-off dumpster on a public street •
  Building decks over a certain height, such as 30" above grade • Doing anything
  with a sewer line • Building an addition to your home • Carport building •
  Exterior doors, windows and skylights that require a new opening • Electrical
  circuits and service • Fireplaces, wood-burning stoves, and inserts • Some
  sink renovations that deal with new plumbing • Garage conversions •
  Home-business conversions • Creating mother-in-law apartments • New furnaces •
  New water heaters • Roof overlays • Pools No matter what the project, it’s
  better to be prepared when it comes to permits and know what is required. The
  International Building Code requires you to receive a permit before any
  renovations that make any substantial alteration to a structure. Pulled from a
  permit inspection website, we are given a very clear message on the importance
  of following the rules. “Not only is it the law, but building permits can also
  protect you. With a building permit, you get the advice of plan reviewers and
  inspectors who will approve each phase of your project, checking to see that
  the work is done in accordance with the building code, zoning laws, and the
  approved plans. Additionally, a building permit is required to show compliance
  with sanitary, safety and welfare concerns, including required setbacks from
  property lines and adjacent structures. Working without a permit, when a
  permit is required, can result in fines and can cause problems when you sell
  your home. More importantly, you lose the assurance that the work you’re
  paying for is built to code, a minimum standard for safety.” We do hope your
  renovation and permit process goes well, and feel free to comment below with
  any comments or questions regarding your progress! Sources:
