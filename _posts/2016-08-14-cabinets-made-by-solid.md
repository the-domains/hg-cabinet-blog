Remodeling and Permits: When is it Necessary?  
  
"Did you get a permit for that?" are probably words that you may hear even while completing seemingly simple DIY renovation tasks. Although it can be a pain to go through the process, you will feel more confident about your work knowing that it is allowed in your area! Did you know that you could be fined or penalized for going through with a project without a permit if it is required? Although it probably wouldn't affect you in the short run, it may just catch up! Of course with smaller projects (painting, tiling, moving cabinetry, etc.) cities do not require the same thorough compliance as do with other projects.  
In general, a building permit is required by your city of residence whenever you undertake the erection, construction, alteration, movement, enlargement, improvement, conversion, removal or demolition of a building. Just about every conceivable type of work falls into one of these categories. Electrical rewiring work, plumbing, tearing down a wall, fixing the roof and adding a bathroom are just a few examples. Because the process of getting a permit can be a hassle and they have a fee associated with them, some home owners are tempted to sidestep the permit process not wanting to pay the fees (municipalities generally charge a minimum issuing fee---such as $25---as well as an additional fee---sometimes 1 percent---of total construction costs), or they might not want to risk delaying a project or a sale by waiting for city inspections (obtaining permits can take anywhere from a day to six weeks or more). The main reason a city requires permits for some renovation projects is to ensure sure work is being done safely. If you do have specific questions regarding your city's protocols, make sure to contact them and double check! Another option would be to talk to local contractors and architects on what is allowed. We compiled a list of well-known projects that usually (but really, double check with your city) require permits:  
  
  
• Demolishing a load-bearing wall  
  
• Changing the house's roofline  
  
• Altering the footprint of your house  
  
• Installing any new electrical wiring  
  
• Installing a fence over a certain height, such as 6'  
  
• Parking your roll-off dumpster on a public street  
  
• Building decks over a certain height, such as 30" above grade  
  
• Doing anything with a sewer line  
  
• Building an addition to your home  
  
• Carport building  
  
• Exterior doors, windows and skylights that require a new opening  
  
• Electrical circuits and service  
  
• Fireplaces, wood-burning stoves, and inserts  
  
• Some sink renovations that deal with new plumbing  
  
• Garage conversions  
  
• Home-business conversions  
  
• Creating mother-in-law apartments  
  
• New furnaces  
  
• New water heaters  
  
• Roof overlays  
  
• Pools  
  
No matter what the project, it's better to be prepared when it comes to permits and know what is required. The International Building Code requires you to receive a permit before any renovations that make any substantial alteration to a structure. Pulled from a permit inspection website, we are given a very clear message on the importance of following the rules.  
"Not only is it the law, but building permits can also protect you. With a building permit, you get the advice of plan reviewers and inspectors who will approve each phase of your project, checking to see that the work is done in accordance with the building code, zoning laws, and the approved plans. Additionally, a building permit is required to show compliance with sanitary, safety and welfare concerns, including required setbacks from property lines and adjacent structures. Working without a permit, when a permit is required, can result in fines and can cause problems when you sell your home. More importantly, you lose the assurance that the work you're paying for is built to code, a minimum standard for safety."  
  
We do hope your renovation and permit process goes well, and feel free to comment below with any comments or questions regarding your progress!
