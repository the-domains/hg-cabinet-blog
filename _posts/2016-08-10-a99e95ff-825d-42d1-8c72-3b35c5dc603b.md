Tips for Remodeling Your Bathroom 1\. Have a plan. When tackling a DIY project like the bathroom, most might ask: "Where do I start?" To make it as headache free as possible, start by creating a plan of action. Are you remodeling strictly for design or more in depth issues like plumping and electrical? Create a roadmap that includes the planned layout, materials, fixtures, finishes, labor, time frame, and budget and do your best to stick to the original remodeling plan to control costs. Something else to consider is obtaining blueprints of your home to see exactly where the plumbing and electrical layouts are; this will help save time and money if you can avoid changing the existing lines. 2\. Know when to call. Knowing when to hand your project over can sometimes be tricky. Unless previously trained in plumbing and electrical work, it's usually best to leave it to trained professionals. Seek out potential contractors to get quotes and ideas on what the estimated cost will be. Make sure to include a time estimate, ask for references, and make sure all licenses and insurances are up to date. Once work has begun - a process that averages two to three months - resist changing your mind. Work stoppages and alterations add costs that may be unnecessary. Know that many things can easily be done DIY style such as installing window and baseboard trim, painting walls and trim, installing the toilet, shelves, and towel bars; with little or no experience, tackling these items will save you hundreds of dollars and not cause too much of a headache. 3\. Think design concepts through. Now that you have a range of cost for the contractor, it's important to know what you want the layout of your bathroom to look like. Don't be afraid to sketch something out. If design isn't your strong suit, consider hiring a designer to help with this portion of the project (prices vary from $70-$200 or so hourly.) Figure out what fixtures you want, tile, placement of cabinetry and toilet, paint color, and any other extra things you want to change. Whether or not you purchase materials yourself or have the contractor do it, make sure to purchase quality materials that can withhold the exposure to heat, moisture, steam, mildew, and other causes of deterioration. Longer lasting materials will ultimately be more cost effective. 4\. Simplicity is best. Once you've jumped into the renovation, try to use corners and other forgotten areas in the bathroom. It's amazing what space can be found when using a minimalist approach. A wall hung toilet or sink, a petit corner sink, or replacing the old tub with a shower are all great ways to use the most of a smaller space. Light colored paint goes a long way in a bathroom, as do large mirrors, which can make the room double in size.
